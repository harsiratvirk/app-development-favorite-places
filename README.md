**Grade**: Passed

**Form of assessment**: Home exam

**Date**: 23/11/2025

## Task description
Create an application that allows users to register attractive places they like by clicking on a map. The app should use a MariaDB database hosted at dave3600.cs.oslomet.no. The places should be displayed as markers on the map. When a user clicks on a marker, they should be able to see information about the place, including the title, description, street address, and GPS coordinates.

The app must include a web service to retrieve data from the database in the form of JSON objects, as well as a web service to add new data. Both web services should be implemented in PHP.

The project will be run on a Pixel 9 device using API level 16.

The project must also include a report containing screenshots of the app, justification for design choices, and other relevant details, which should be placed in the res/raw folder.
